# Whiteboarding 101

Consistently updated for personal referece and practice

## PROCESS:

Find enough space to write ideas, pseudocode, and code. Work in pairs if allowed. Never go silent: talk out your thoughts, ask questions, rubber duck, explain your results. When lacking clarity - ask your interviewer.

Work in phases. Timebox how long each phase should take:

1. No code - plain psuedocode - MOST IMPORTANT STEP.
2. Only whiteboard - no computer coding, write code out and explain what you are writing as you go.
3. Review - Test in editor

## TIPS

The [biggest mistake](https://blog.pramp.com/top-8-mistakes-in-technical-interviews-according-to-data-27d2572bda1f) an interviewee can make during a whiteboarding challenge is jumping straight to writing code. Use at least a few minutes to reiterate the problem, ask any clarifying questions, and explain your typical _process_ for solving a problem. Key points to mention in the 'no code' phase:

1. your assumed inputs (after clarifying with interviewer)
2. the output you expect to have at the end.
3. the process/manipulations you will have to accomplish in order to get input to become the output.
